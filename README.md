Morphia provides an annotation-driven approach to mapping POJO based entities into and out of MongoDB.

This project is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/morphia/, taken from SVN trunk at revision 1826 (Jul 2012). This original work was authored by Scott Hernandez et al.

The intention of this fork is to:

1. Improve the documentation
2. Provide a 1.0 release
3. Maintain compatibility with newer MongoDB driver releases
4. Fix and improve the code
